{{< faq "Can I use Halcyon IDE to run nmap?" >}}
Running nmap from Halcyon IDE as port scanner is not the ideal use case of the project because Halcyon IDE is not ideally meant to use as scanner, but rather the development IDE for Nmap scripts. Halcyon IDE interface will not have options to tweak a lot of scan options as compared to running nmap directly. If you are looking into a GUI for running nmap, Zenmap is undoubtedly the better choice.
