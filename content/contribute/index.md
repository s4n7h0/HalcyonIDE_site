Quo vadis?  

## Features or Bugs

Currently, Halcyon IDE is maintained by the author individually. I would be happy to see more ideas for the improvement of Halcyon IDE from the community. Share your thoughts, suggest new features, do test cases, report bugs and help Halcyon IDE to grow.   
 

## Talks

If you like Halcyon IDE project, talk about it. Social media has made it easier to discuss what you like in the project or what changes you would want to see in future releases. 

## Documentation

I also welcome blogposts or tutorials on nmap writing using Halcyon IDE. Let that be simpler or magnificantly advanced, let us all learn from it. 
 
## Coffee & Coins

I'll leave it here :)
