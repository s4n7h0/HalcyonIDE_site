- An IDE is certainly little more than normal text editor. Halcyon IDE provides a beautiful user interface that can highlight the source code syntactically and semantically and makes it easier for faster development.

- The side panel besides the workspace is easier to navigate through the important nmap files, especially the scripts, library, and data directories.

- The scanning options such as scan type, script arguments, argument file, packet tracking and other debugging settings can be configurable within the interface.

- The post development actions such as exporting the scripts into Nmap installation directory and updating script database is simplified in the interface.
