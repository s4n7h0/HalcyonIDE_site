The initial spark of the idea behind what is Halcyon IDE today came from the random discussions with Wasim Halani [@washalsec](https://twitter.com/washalsec), a fellow researcher and my colleague back then. The project was initially created for my personal use and Wasim gave the confidence to share it with the community hoping the project would be helpful to like-minded nmap script developers. 

The nmap script developers community also helped with timely feedbacks and suggestions which was helpful for the project to grow consistently so far.
